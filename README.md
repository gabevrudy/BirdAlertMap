# BirdAlertMap

Bird Alert Map is a project website, hosted on github pages, that displays a map showing all the birds that have been seen the previous day, in my county, that I have not seen yet for the year or in my life (commonly referred to as a Need Alert).  

Due to this being a side project I thought it might be a good idea to create this Readme in an Obsidian vault to document my notes and process.
