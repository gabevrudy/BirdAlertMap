# Introduction

Bird Alert Map is a project website, hosted on github pages, that displays a map showing all the birds that have been seen the previous day, in my county, that I have not seen yet for the year or in my life (commonly referred to as a Need Alert).  

Due to this being a side project I thought it might be a good idea to create this Readme in an Obsidian vault to document my notes and process.

## Version History
## ![[v.0.0.1]]

## Blockers

* Custom SVG: For some reason, when I use a custom svg, they're not anchoring correctly and when I zoom out, they're not located in the proper place.  

## Future Feature/Enhancements

* [ ]  Setup Github Action for live data
* [ ] Differentiate between Year List and Life List
	* [ ] Change symbology (blue v red pins?) 
	* [ ] Maybe show birds that have been seen in the last week as yellow?
* [ ] Show notes on website
	* [ ] Add a tab to switch between notes graph and the map
* [ ] Add legend to map
* [ ] Add menu/nav/info
* [ ] Turn off/on layers
* [ ] Confirmed Birds v Unconfirmed birds
* [ ] ABA Rarities?  Maybe only for California...
