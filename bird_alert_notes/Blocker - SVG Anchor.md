Check the SVG content's dimensions.  If for example (width="256" height="256"), and we want the bottom/center of the pin to be the point.  Given the image size of 256x256, the iconAnchor should then be at (128, 256), halfway across the width for the X coordinate, and all the way down the height for the Y coordinate.   Now this is a huge size for a map symbol so scale it down to be for example 32, 32 with the icon anchor being 16, 32 and then setting the pop-up to display above the icon in the center at (0, -32).
